<h3>iOS</h3>

<p>
  In <b>Death off the Cuff</b> and <b>PataNoir</b>, restoring a save after restarting the game will not restore the unlocked pictures in the <b>Info</b> tab.
</p>
<p>
  A fix is forthcoming. A workaround is to save the game at the beginning and restore that save instead of restarting.
</p>

<h3>Android</h3>

<p>
    There is an issue with the custom keyboard on some phone models not working with the games.
    This can be fixed by either switching to the standard Android keyboard in <b>Settings: Language and Input</b>, or
    downloading the <b>Swype Keyboard</b> from Google Play.
</p>
<p>
  This problem should now be fixed, but I'm leaving this note, in case it still occurs on some phones.
