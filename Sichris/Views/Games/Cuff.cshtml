        "They all stare at you expectantly, like children waiting to be told a bedtime story. Who who can blame them? You are, after
        all, Antoine Saint Germain, the great French Detective. No criminal has ever been a match for you, and everybody is looking
        forward to a description of your brilliant deductions. There is just one small problem. One tiny detail that makes it different
        this time. A mere trifle, really. This time you have no idea who did it."

<p>
    "Death Off the Cuff" is a humorous detective game, in which you must try to bluff your way through the final reveal
    of the murderer, without letting people know that you have no idea who it is. It took fifth place in  <a href="http://www.ifcomp.org/comp10">The Interactive Fiction Competition 2010</a>, and
    went on to win the <a href="http://www.xyzzyawards.org">Xyzzy Award</a> for Best Individual PC.
    It has since then been significantly improved, with more things to do, colorful illustrations, and
    application interfaces for iOS and Android.
</p>

<p>
    The game is available for both iOS and Android and as a Windows executable through itch.io.

  <summary><b>Behind the scenes</b></summary>
  <p>
      Death off the Cuff was originally based on an idea I had for designing a conversation system where the
      topics would be limited to objects in the environment, thereby fixing the usual "guess-the-topic" problem
      where the player has to ask about every conceivable topic, until he encounters one the game recognizes.</p>
  <p>
      For this reason, the competition release only allowed you to talk about visible objects and people.
      However, this was widely considered a design flaw, so the current release has abandoned the original
      idea and now allows you to talk about abstract topics, such as the murder victim, the time of death, and
      the alibis and motives of the suspects.
