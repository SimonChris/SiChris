    PataNoir is a homage to the classic stories of hard-boiled private
    investigators with a knack for describing everything with complex similes and metaphors. It took fifth place
    in the 2011 <a href="http://www.ifcomp.org/comp11/">Interactive Fiction Competition</a>, and was later awarded
    the <a href="http://www.xyzzyawards.org">Xyzzy Award</a> for Best Puzzles. It has also been featured
    in <a href="http://pataphormagazine.com">Pataphor Magazine</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The game can currently be played online at the Interactive Fiction Database. An illustrated app version for iOS and Android is in
    production.

<p>PataNoir is also available in German as <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=j8pvi7xkiyglqb52">PataNoir - Ein unvergleichlicher Kriminalfall</a>.</p>

  <summary><b>Behind the scenes</b></summary>
  <p>
    The idea for PataNoir came to me after learning about Alfred Jarry's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Pataphysics">pataphysics</a>, and
    the related concept of the <a href="http://www.pataphor.com/">pataphor</a> &#8212 a metaphor that becomes reality. I had
    long been wanting to make a noir game where hard-boiled metaphors would somehow be an essential part of the gameplay, but I couldn't
    quite figure out how to pull this off. I considered having the player select metaphors from a menu, which would then affect how the
    scene played out, but it just didn't go anywhere.
  </p>
  <p>
    The pataphor provided an obvious gameplay mechanic. Manipulating objects is, after all, an essential part of most adventure games, so if a
    metaphor became an object, it could be manipulated like any other. Thus, PataNoir was born.
